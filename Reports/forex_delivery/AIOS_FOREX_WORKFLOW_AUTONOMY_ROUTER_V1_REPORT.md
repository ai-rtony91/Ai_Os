# AIOS Forex Workflow Autonomy Router V1 Report

Workflow status: WORKFLOW_BLOCKED_ON_OWNER_SAFETY_EVIDENCE
Current branch: main
Current head: 29b53f21e411ced485084060e2bf59b76edc15c8
Active lane: OWNER_SAFETY_EVIDENCE_CLOSURE
Active phase: SAFETY_EVIDENCE_CLOSURE_PENDING
Active blocker: kill_switch_state
Next safe action: Owner must provide or repair owner-sanitized evidence for kill_switch_state, daily_stop_state, max_loss_state, monitoring_ready; keep broker, demo, live micro, live trading, and vacation modes locked.

Locked modes:
- broker_probe: True
- demo_proof: True
- live_micro: True
- live_trading: True
- vacation_mode: True

Safety boundary:
- order_execution_allowed: False
- broker_api_allowed: False
- credentials_allowed: False
- live_trading_authorized: False
- account_identifier_persistence_allowed: False
- scheduler_allowed: False
- daemon_allowed: False
- webhook_allowed: False

Active blockers:
- kill_switch_state
- daily_stop_state
- max_loss_state
- monitoring_ready

Decision reasons:
- Owner safety evidence controls are still missing or blocked: kill_switch_state, daily_stop_state, max_loss_state, monitoring_ready
- Finish-line next-safe guidance: Close critical safety evidence for kill_switch_state, daily_stop_state, max_loss_state, monitoring_ready; keep broker, demo, live micro, live trading, and vacation modes locked.
- Closure next-safe guidance: Close controller-reported critical safety blockers for kill_switch_state, daily_stop_state, max_loss_state, monitoring_ready; keep broker, demo, live micro, live trading, and vacation modes locked.
- Discovery candidate weak for kill_switch_state: status=DISCOVERED_WEAK_CANDIDATE, safe_to_cite=false
- Discovery candidate weak for daily_stop_state: status=DISCOVERED_WEAK_CANDIDATE, safe_to_cite=false
- Discovery candidate weak for max_loss_state: status=DISCOVERED_WEAK_CANDIDATE, safe_to_cite=false
- Discovery candidate weak for monitoring_ready: status=DISCOVERED_WEAK_CANDIDATE, safe_to_cite=false
