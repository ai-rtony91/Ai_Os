# AIOS Owner Authority Workflow V1

## Purpose

This is **Part B** of the post-A/B/C/D 17-phase gateway program.

Its job is to remove repeated operator stop/go loops. AIOS should prepare as much engineering work as possible and collect only the actions that cannot be delegated to software. Owner work is consolidated into a small number of authority bundles.

This document is subordinate to `AGENTS.md`. It does not grant authority, alter protected-action policy, or bypass any existing approval gate.

## Operating rule

The workflow uses **PREPARE_BEHIND_GATE**:

1. AIOS may inspect, design, implement, test, document, and prepare evidence for a phase when those actions are permitted by existing repository policy.
2. When a phase reaches a non-delegable action, AIOS records that action in the appropriate owner bundle instead of repeatedly interrupting the owner.
3. AIOS may continue preparing downstream work that does not cross the protected boundary.
4. A protected transition stays blocked until a trusted owner-approval receipt is supplied through an existing approved authority path.
5. After the receipt is validated upstream, AIOS may resume the corresponding work automatically.

The helper module in this milestone does **not** validate owner identity or approval receipts. It only compiles and exposes the owner-action plan.

## Maximum owner interaction target

The 17 phases are consolidated into **four planned owner sessions maximum**:

| Bundle | Phases | Owner purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `OWNER-BUNDLE-1-POLICY` | 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 | Privacy, residual risk, confidence, fallback, liveness, memory, and risk-threshold policy |
| `OWNER-BUNDLE-2-DEVICE-IDENTITY` | 4, 5, 9 | Phone/provider control, trusted-device enrollment, YubiKey/passkey possession |
| `OWNER-BUNDLE-3-RUNTIME-SECRETS` | 14, 15, 16 | Runtime activation, The_Lab authority boundary, protected vault/session configuration |
| `OWNER-BUNDLE-4-LOCATION-PRIVACY` | 17 | Explicit location/privacy consent |

Phases 1, 12, and 13 require no separate owner checkpoint under this V1 plan.

Four is a consolidation target, not permission to suppress a genuinely non-delegable action discovered later. Any newly discovered protected action must remain blocked unless existing authority already covers it.

## Safety boundaries

This milestone performs no:

- passkey or YubiKey enrollment;
- secret or credential storage;
- phone-provider mutation;
- voice call or SMS operation;
- runtime deployment;
- broker or trading operation;
- location access;
- automatic approval;
- automatic merge authority.

The manifest stores only descriptions of owner actions. Secret values, recovery codes, private keys, access tokens, and passkey material must never be written into the repository.

## Integration with Part A

Part A remains the engineering/autonomy lane. It can later call:

- `load_manifest()`
- `build_owner_authority_plan()`
- `phase_execution_mode()`
- `first_pending_owner_bundle()`

The intended integration is a sidecar authority check around the existing A/B/C/D task lifecycle, not a replacement controller and not a second governance head.

Until that integration is separately implemented and validated, the merged A/B/C/D runner remains unchanged.

## Deletion/consolidation rule

No existing file should be deleted merely because Part B exists. Delete or supersede an artifact only after repository evidence proves it is a duplicate of this workflow and the deletion is within an approved change scope.
